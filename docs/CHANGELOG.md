### Technical Decisions [2024-11-26 02:21:00 ET]
- Edit mode implementation:
  - Separate mode for layout modifications
  - Visual indicators for editable elements
  - Prevents accidental changes
- History management:
  - Deep cloning for state preservation
  - Circular buffer for memory efficiency
  - Atomic state updates
- Winston chosen for logging due to:
  - Industry standard logging levels
  - Built-in support for multiple transports
  - Extensible format system
  - Strong TypeScript support
- Log rotation implemented to:
  - Prevent unbounded disk usage
  - Maintain organized log history
  - Enable easy log archival
- Correlation IDs added to:
  - Track request flow through the system
  - Enable distributed tracing
  - Facilitate debugging
- Dependency tracking implemented to:
  - Prevent version conflicts early
  - Ensure build stability
  - Maintain consistent dependency state

### Architecture [2024-11-26 02:21:00 ET]
- Modular logging system with separate concerns:
  - Error logging for system errors
  - API logging for external interactions
  - Audit logging for system events
- Performance monitoring system for API calls
- Daily log rotation with compression
- Automated dependency validation pipeline
